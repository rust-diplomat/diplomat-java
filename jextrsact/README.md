jext**rs**act intends to be a minimal conversion tool for generating [JEP 454](https://openjdk.org/jeps/454) 
binding code for diplomat types and functions. It is purely theoretical at this point but should be 
relatively straightforward. One can use [the native code](../feature/java/somelib/src/main/java/dev/diplomattest/somelib/ntv)
as an example.
